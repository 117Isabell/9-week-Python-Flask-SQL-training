"""
This Python provides functions to connect to a MySQL database and perform CRUD operations on a 'k_dramas' table,
including fetching all dramas, getting dramas above a certain rating, and adding new dramas.

Make sure to customize the db_config.py and any other configuration files according to your setup.
Ensure your database schema matches the expected structure used in your queries
and you can run the sql script file in the assignment-4-sql_scripts folder in MySQL workbench to set up a db and a table.

Functions:
- get_all_dramas(): Fetches and prints all dramas from the database.
- get_dramas_above_rating(rating_score): Fetches and prints dramas with a rating above the specified score.
- add_drama(drama): Adds a new drama to the database.
